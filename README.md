## Product classes
Created a class for Products. Defined a function to initialize attributes related to products.The attributes are product ids,names,active status of policy holders and description.To update products,I defined a function that starts with no product name or description.Def suspend(self): is a function to suspend a product hence making the product inactive.Lastly, I defined a string that shows the active status of a product or whether it is suspended.Returns product_id,the name of the client and status of product.
### Policy holder
Created a class for policyholder.Defined a function that initializes the attributes id,name and status of the policyholder.I then defined a function that registers a customer and assigns a specific product.If else statement allows registration if the status of the policy holder is active.Else statement ensures that a policy holder cant register for a product if not active.Policy is registered if the policyholder is active.I defined functions to suspend and reactivate a policyholder.After reactivation,status becomes active.After suspension,the status of the policyholder changes to suspended.Then defined a function that allows policholder to make or add payment.The last function defines a string that returns policyholders' id,name and the products they are subscribed to.
#### Payment class
I started by importing datetime library which enables me calculate the differences in dates.Then I created a class for payment.I defined a function that initializes attributes of amount,due_date and paid_date.I equated paid_date to None since the date is only gotten when a policyholder pays.The penalty=o since it is only valued when calculated.I defined a function that processes payments and equates paid date to pay date.If a policy holder pays past the due date,delay of days is calculating by subtracting the self.due date from pay date.Penalty is calculated by multiplying the delay by 20.This implies that for everyday the policyholder delays by a day,they attract a fine of 20$.I then defined a function that reminds the policyholder about the due date.When today is the due_date,I return payment is due and mention the day that payment is due.If today is before the due dat,then I will remind the policyholder that there is an upcoming payment due on the due-date.I then defined a string that shows when a payment was made.If it was not made,then not paid but paid comes with the date of payment which is paid date.The return shows amount paid by the customer,the due date and the penalty accrued.
##### 2 Policy holders who have paid
Imported policyholder script from policyholder.product from product and payment from payment.Imported the library datetime for calculation of date differences.I listed product 1 and 2 as health insurance and car insurance.Holder1 and 2 are the two policy holders.i registered the policyholders to specific products.Processed payments while claculating the penalties.holder 1 and 2 added/made payments.I printed polcy holder details with the payments made.
